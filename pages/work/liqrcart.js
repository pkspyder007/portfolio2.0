            95% of our audience was mobile users as they lack high speed internet connectivity.
            So keeping the UI as close as a native app was the best option and this allowed me to <u><strong>re-use</strong></u>
            &nbsp; multiple components across the application.

            The project had 3 levels of users. Client, Vender and The Admin. <br />
            The vendor and admin section shared a lot of similar components and logic as product views, stats, etc.

            I took my whiteboard and tried to come up with some main entities the app we will be having. Laid them on the whiteboard and created some relationship with each other. 
            <br />
            For example:
            <br />
            An user should be able to access all his/her previous orders and each order should have the details of the products. 
            <br />
            Now the product should have a refrence to the shop from where it originated and similarly with the payments. Who did the payment, what they paid for, whome the paid, etc.

            This was also really challenging part. I needed to <u><strong>avoid as much code duplication</strong></u> as i could.

            <u><strong>Securing the API</strong></u> was also a curcial part. For this i went with <u><strong>JSON Web Tokens</strong></u> and <u><strong>custom express.js middlewares</strong></u> for checkin the authentication of the request.
